# About me:

Hi, I‚Äôm Martin, a second-year Data Science master‚Äôs student at ITU. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been fascinated by artificial intelligence‚Äîwhether it was watching sci-fi movies growing up, thinking about how AI has surpassed humans in different fields, or later building AI systems myself.

I‚Äôm currently writing my thesis on mechanistic interpretability, which is essentially the neuroscience of AI models. This field aims to better understand how neural networks function, helping us make them more transparent, reproducible, and safer.

Alongside my studies, I work at a Danish C25 company, building AI agents that automate processes and improve workflows across multiple departments.

What sets me apart is my hands-on experience in an emerging field‚ÄîLLMs. I‚Äôve built real products, iterated on them, and continuously improved them, giving me a deep understanding of practical AI development.

### üß¨Disease simulation spread

In 2021, I set out to model how diseases could spread in networks along with a few friends. 
This simulation shows exponential nature of a disease, portrait in red, followed by the collapse of connectioned, showed by the decline in grey lines.

### üßæNLP paper


This [paper](https://github.com/MartinKirkegaardDK/Projects/blob/main/Span%20labeling/Group3%202ndyearproject.pdf), which I wrote in collaboration with a few students, goes in depth with a subsection of the NLP-field called span-detection, which is the task of classifying spans of tokens.
Can state of the art deep learning models be improved by including multiple feature extraction?
