# About me:

26 year old student with a Bsc Data Science from the IT-University of Copenhagen.
With a drive to learn about the world, I often spend my time trying to understand new concepts and phenomena.
A goal which I have set for myself is to become better at chess, more specificly hitting a 1000 elo.
My latest achievement is to solve a rubrics cube under 1 minute!

My dream job would be to combine my professional experience of working as a software engineer and combining it with my academic knowledge from studying data science.

### What is data science?
Data science is the ability to incorporate contextual knowledge with data to create value. 
To achieve this skill set it is important that one has a strong understanding of technical theory, such as statistics and machine learning, while
also has the knowhow of being able to convey key findings.
If done succesfully, it can bring immeasurable value to any organization.

### üß¨Disease simulation spread

In 2021, I set out to model how diseases could spread in networks along with a few friends. 
This simulation shows exponential nature of a disease, portrait in red, followed by the collapse of connectioned, showed by the decline in grey lines.

### üßæNLP paper


This [paper](https://github.com/MartinKirkegaardDK/Projects/blob/main/Span%20labeling/Group3%202ndyearproject.pdf), which I wrote in collaboration with a few students, goes in depth with a subsection of the NLP-field called span-detection, which is the task of classifying spans of tokens.
Can state of the art deep learning models be improved by including multiple feature extraction?
