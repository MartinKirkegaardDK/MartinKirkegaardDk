# About me:

24 year old student studying Bsc Data Science at the IT-University of Copenhagen.
With drive to learn about the world, I often spend my time trying to understand new things about the world.
My latest project was improving my time to solve a rubrics cube and is finally below 1 minut!


My dream job would be to work with machine learning while trying to advance the field as a whole.
